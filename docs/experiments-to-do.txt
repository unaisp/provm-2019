1. What is the performance impact on an application due to the 
   partitioning of dm-cache ?

   Allocate a 10 GB of SSD for dm-cache, and run the experiments.
   Later allocate 20 GB of SSD for dm-cache and partition it
   to two 10 GB groups. Run the application on one of the group
   and measure the performance. Compare the results.

   Application : fio
               : workload :  ?
   Matrix	     : average hit ratio
               : average throughput

2. How the applications behave when the dm-cache is partitioned
   and is not partitioned ?

   Exp 1: Run 3 applications on dm-cache. Measure individual 
          throughput and hitratio continuously. <How ???>

   Exp 2: Create 3 c-groups and allocate the groups with equal
          weightage. Move the process to one of the group and 
          run the above experiment.

   Measure the hitratio and throughput continuously and compare
   the results.

   Hint: To measure seperate hitratio of each application in the 
         Exp1, move the processes into a c-groups. So the dm-cache
         can differentaite the IO traffic, and update seperate
         counters for each IO operation.

3. How applications performs with different size of cache allocation
   and how they adapt to the change in the cache-allocation ? 

   Create 3 cgroups with weight 1:2:3. Run fio on each group and
   measure the performance of each.

   Workload : ?
   Matrix   : hit ratio
            : throughput

   Window 1: A1, A2, A3 starts.
             cg1:cg2:cg3 = 1:2:3
   Window 2: cg1:cg2:cg3 = 2:2:3
   Window 3: cg1:cg2:cg3 = 2:2:1 
   Window 4: App 1 stops 
   			     cg1:cg2:cg3 = 0:2:1

4. End to end experiment
   a. based of weightage
   b. based on performance
